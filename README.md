# Deep Learning Projects - Phase 1

This repository contains deep learning projects built using Python and various deep learning libraries. These projects showcase applications in image detection and sound classification.

## Projects Included:

1. **Sound Classification**
   - A model to classify sounds based on training data.
   
2. **Image Detection**
   - Includes multiple components:
     - `myWebApp`: Web application to interact with image detection models.
     - `templates`: Templates for web app.
     - `imgUpload`: A directory for uploading images.

## Requirements:

Ensure that you have the following libraries installed:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Cufflinks
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (For image processing tasks)

## Installation Instructions:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DebjyotiSaha/Deep-Learning-Projects-Phase-1.git
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. For image detection tasks, you may want to use **Google Colab** or any IDE that supports OpenCV.

## Usage:

- **Sound Classification**: Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the model on sound data.
- **Image Detection**: Launch the web app (`myWebApp`) to upload and classify images.
